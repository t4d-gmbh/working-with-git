# Overview

What we have called **origin** for now, and simply referred to as the _remote location or device_ can refer to anything from as single-board computer to a massive cloud service.

In fact, with the popularity of `git` the service of offering a repositories **origin** has become an economically relevant business with service provides extending considerably the list of the provided features beyond the already rich functionalities `git` the version control system includes.


To give an idea bout the kind of service provides we talk about, here is a non-extensive list:

- GitHub &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://github.com)
- GitLab &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://gitlab.com)
- Bitbucket &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://bitbucket.org)
- Gitea &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://gitea.com)

Most, if not all, of these services provide extensive documentation for the features they offer and we recommend searching specific information directly their documentation.
What we want to focus here is to provide a categorization of the services they offer.

Also, for now we will only focus on the two service providers most known to us: **GitLab** and **GitHub**
