# Further reading

You will find tons of tutorials, blogs, books and forums discussions about _How to work with git_ or _Branching strategies with git_, etc.

Here you will find a very short selection of what we consider "worth reading" and why:

:::{dropdown} [Martin Fowler's blog about "Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html)
Provides an exhaustive overview of a variety of strategies and patterns for branching that are applied by developer teams.

The blog does not require a lot of prior or technical knowledge, is structure in a didactic way and provides both visual aids, as well as, various potentially helpful analogies.

It is a bit on the longer side of how an "easy read" might look like.
Also you will learn about various strategies, but not on particular ways to implement them.

:::
:::{dropdown} [Julia Evans' "git branches: intuition & reality"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/23/branches-intuition-reality/)

This blog is more on the technical side but with a strong focus on contextualization.
It also highlights some fancier ways to use git commands (like `git log --all --oneline --graph`) and provides various standpoints to what certain commands are conceptually doing and thus allows to gain a better understanding.

This rather short read, however, will not provide much directly applicable strategies about working with git.
:::
:::{dropdown} [Atlassians' tutorial about "Merging vs. rebasing"](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

A well structured text that firmly compares the two consolidation strategies, _merging_ and _rebasing_.
It start from a conceptual standpoint, then walks through both processes step-by-step and concludes with considerations about when which strategy should be preferred.

This article exclusively focusses on an in-depth explanation of the principles between the two consolidation strategies, _merging_ and _rebasing_.
