## Workflows

While above elements can all exist independently, there is an intuitive order to their life cycle:

1. One would typically start with defining a Milestone to set a general goal or direction
2. Smaller more actionable steps to move in this direction can then be defined in several Issues
3. Actual implementations of these steps can happen on specific branches for which a corresponding Merge/Pull request asserts the integration onto the codebase
