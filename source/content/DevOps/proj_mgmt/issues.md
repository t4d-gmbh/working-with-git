### Issues

<!-- pages-include -->

Is a rather genuine piece of information tied to a repository.

It consists of a title, a description and several optional arguments, like an assignee, labels, a due date, etc.

The term _issue_ should not be taken to literally, in this context and idea, a proposition or a question are all _issues_.
