### Merge/Pull requests

<!-- pages-include -->

This element is the most closely tied to a branch in `git`.

In fact a `Merge request` (GitLab) or `Pull request` (GitHub) consists of a title, a description and two branches.

It defines a suggestion (or request) to incorporate one branch into the other.
