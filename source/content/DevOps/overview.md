# Overview

What we have called **origin** for now, and simply referred to as the _remote location or device_ can refer to anything from as single-board computer to a massive cloud service.

In fact, with the popularity of <i class="fab fa-git"></i> the service of offering a repositories' **origin** has become an economically relevant business with service providers extending considerably the list of the provided features beyond the already rich functionalities <i class="fab fa-git"></i>, the version control system, includes.


To give an idea about the kind of service providers we're talking about, here is a non-extensive list:

- GitHub &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://github.com)
- GitLab &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://gitlab.com)
- Bitbucket &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://bitbucket.org)
- Gitea &nbsp;[{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://gitea.com)

Most, if not all, of these services provide extensive documentation about features they offer and we recommend searching specific information directly in their documentation.
What we want to focus on here is to provide a categorization of the services they offer.

Also, for now we will only consider the two service providers most known to us: **GitLab** and **GitHub**
