# Access Control

This is one of the main extra features **origin**-services provide.

They do not just allow repository owners to give access to a repository they host, but they offer:

- fine grained access control to both content and functions or actions
- provide controlled access on organisational levels ranging over multiple repositories
- allow to further distribute access rights
- protect certain resources (e.g protected `main` branch)


When it gets to access control GitLab and GitHub follow different approaches.
