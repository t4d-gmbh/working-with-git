### Tracking changes

As a version control system it provides easily accessible functionalities to:

- generate a history of changes in a repository
- verify the integrity of the history[^sn1]


[^sn1]: A state is identified by a hash of the content and each state contains the hash of its preceding state(s), also called _parent(s)_, leading to a unique identifier of the entire history.
