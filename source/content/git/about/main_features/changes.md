### Managing changes

Git comes with a rich tool-set to curate and manipulate a repository's history.
It can:

- consolidate changes from different sources
- identify conflicting changes and allow to transparently resolve them
- maintain multiple versions concurrently
- exchange incremental changes between different versions
