### Commits

A Git commit represents **a single step in the history of a repository**.

A commit is the **result of an action initiated by a developer** that can (and must) decide not just when to create a commit, but also, **it is up to the developer to decide what changes go into a commit**.

**Technically a commit corresponds to a snapshot of the entire repository** including a reference to the parent commits(s).[^sn1]

[^sn1]: While it is technically correct to consider commits as snapshots, it might be more practical to **think about commits as changes**.
