### Branches

A branch in Git is a way to create and simultaneously maintain different versions of a repository.

They offer the possibility to develop and test new features and maintain various versions.

In Git, technically,  **a branch is just a pointer to a specific commit**, all the added value of a branches derives from the fact that **many operations in Git update the location of that pointer**.
