## Separate subjects
> Any story is easier to follow if there is some consistency in the subject and some logical thread that connects single events.

Developing a repository is similar:

Typically, **a repository contains various types of files** and **a developer performs various tasks**, like
- adding new features
- refactoring existing code
- fixing typos
- completing the documentation.
- ...

With `git` any edit can lead to a commit and a branch can consist of any sequence of commits.
It is up to the developer to associate branches with specific subjects or tasks and distribute commits onto these branches in a meaningful manner.
