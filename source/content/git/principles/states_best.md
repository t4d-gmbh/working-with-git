### Best Practice (4/4)

As a consequence it can become difficult to identify healthy states which is something that can be circumvented by the use of git tags:

<!-- pages-include -->

:::{card} Regularly tag good states
- Tag particular states (see [**git tag**&nbsp;{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag))
- Use a meaningful versioning framework to describe states (e.g. [semver&nbsp;{octicon}`link-external;0.8em`](https://semver.org/))
