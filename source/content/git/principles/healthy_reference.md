## Healthy reference

> A pre-requirement to successfully develop any change, or new feature, is **to be able to depart from a functional state**.

In the `git`-context this translates to:

**You need to know a specific commit on a specific branch that represents a healthy state**

More precisely this state should:

- contain most of the relevant history, i.e. as recent as possible
- have a minimal chance to contain errors
- be functional
