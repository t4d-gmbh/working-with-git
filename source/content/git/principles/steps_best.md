### Best Practice (3/4)

As a consequence we want to fill commits with just enough changes to perform a meaningful step and, therefore:

<!-- pages-include -->

:::{card} Commit small but complete changes
- Decide what changes to include in a commit (use `git add -p`)
- Make a commit as specific as possible
- Write commit messages that specify the purpose of the commit
- Include as few as possible changes into a commit
