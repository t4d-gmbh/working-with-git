### Automatic Synchronization

```{admonition} No coupling between changes and distribution
:class: warning
Synchronization is not coupled to change events in a repository.
```

Therefore:
- collaboration mediated by <i class="fab fa-git"></i> happens asynchronously
- simultaneous editing is not supported
- synchronizing the state of a repository is part of the <i class="fab fa-git"></i> workflow
