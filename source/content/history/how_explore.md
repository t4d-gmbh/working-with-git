{% if slide %}###{% else %}:::{card}{% endif %} How can we explore this history?

In particular we might like to know general things like:

- What happened when/where?
- What changed between here and there?

And particular things like:

- What exactly changed at a specific point?
- When and who changed a specific line in a file?
- What is "my history", i.e. what was I doing?
