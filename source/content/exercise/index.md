# Exercise

Let's plan a weekend trip together!

Here, we will work on a project called "Weekend Out" that will help us plan a weekend trip together. This project will be a great opportunity to practice working with Git and GitHub, as well as collaborating with others on a shared repository.

Please follow the instructions in the README file of the "Weekend Out" repository. 
Solve only the first exercise for now.
You can find the repository and all related materials at the following link:

Happy coding!
