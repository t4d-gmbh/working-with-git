### <strong style="color:black">git stash</strong>

<!-- pages-include -->

This command allow you to "put unstaged changes away" such that you can perform operations on your workspace, such as `git pull`, that would otherwise overwrite files you changed but did not yet add to the stage.

```{note}
`git stash pop` will reapply the changes you had put away.
```
