### <strong style="color:black">git rebase -i</strong>

<!-- pages-include -->

With `git rebase -i` you can rewrite the history of a single branch (see the [Rewriting History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)).
In particular you can clean up a history by squashing several commits into a single commit.

It can be used to get the references of previous stages, including those that did not make it into the history.
